# A-Records (Host address)

The A-record is the most basic and the most commonly used DNS record type.

It is used to translate human friendly domain names such as "www.example.com" into IP-addresses such as 23.211.43.53 (machine friendly numbers).

A-records are the DNS server equivalent of the [hosts file](df_hostsfile.md) - a simple domain name to IP-address mapping.

A-records are not required for all computers, but are needed for any computer that provides shared resources on a network.

To create a new A-record, right-click a zone in the left list of [DNS Records window](wd_records.md), and select "New A-record" from the pop-up menu.

This record type is defined in [RFC1035](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt).
