# User Interface

The Simple DNS Plus user interface consists of 4 primary modules:

[Main window](wd_mainscreen.md)

[DNS Records window](wd_records.md)

[DNS Look Up window](wd_lookup.md)

[DNS Cache Snapshot window](wd_snapshot.md)

Each of these 4 modules run as separate processes which can function independently of the others, and each appear separately in the Windows task bar.

Each module has a number of functions and dialogs which are described in the following sections.
