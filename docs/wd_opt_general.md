# Options dialog - General

- **Host name of this DNS server (FQDN)**\
Used as the default primary DNS server name when creating new [zones](df_zones.md) (for the [SOA-record](rec_soa.md) and [NS-record](rec_ns.md)).\
This is typically something like "ns1.example.com" - with "example.com" being your main domain name.\
This name is also displayed in the title bar of the [main window](wd_mainscreen.md), and as a "Tool Tip" for the tray bar icon for easy reference.

- **Show icon in the Windows taskbar notification area**\
When checked, Simple DNS Plus will be represented by a small icon in the tray bar (typically in the lower right hand corner of the screen, the area next to clock).

- **Automatically check for Simple DNS Plus updates.**\
When checked, Simple DNS Plus will periodically check with JH Software's web-server to see if there is an updated version of Simple DNS Plus available, and if so, display a message about this (only when the U.I. is already open).
