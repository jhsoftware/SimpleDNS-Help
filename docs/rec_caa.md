# CAA-records (Certification Authority Authorization)

Allows a DNS domain name holder to specify one or more Certification Authorities (CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain.

To create a new CAA-record, right-click a zone in the left list in the [DNS Records window](wd_records.md), and select "Other new record" from the pop-up menu.

This record type is defined in [RFC6844](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6844.txt).
