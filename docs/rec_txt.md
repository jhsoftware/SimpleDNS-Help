# TXT-Records (Descriptive text)

TXT-records are used to hold descriptive text.

They are often used to hold general information about a domain name such as who is hosting it, contact person, phone numbers, etc.

One common use of TXT-records is for SPF (see <http://www.open-spf.org>).

To create a new TXT-record, right-click a zone in the left list in the [DNS Records window](wd_records.md), and select "New TXT-record" from the pop-up menu.

This record type is defined in [RFC1035](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt).
