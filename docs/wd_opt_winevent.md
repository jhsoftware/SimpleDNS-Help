# Options dialog - Logging - Windows Event Log

**Record selected events to the Windows Event Log**

With this option enabled, the events checked in the list are written to the Windows Event log (see Windows Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).

You can use the Windows Event Log to run scripts/programs, send e-mail notifications, or perform other actions whenever a specific event occurs.

To configure this use the Windows Task Scheduler.

For details on the different events, see [Event IDs / Error Messages](eventids.md).
