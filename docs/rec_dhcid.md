# DHCID-Records (DHCP Information)

DHCID-records store Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Information, and can be created and used by some DHCP servers and clients.

You cannot create DHCID record through the Simple DNS Plus user interface - these records can only be added by DHCP servers/clients themselves through dynamic updates.

This record type is defined in [RFC4701](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4701.txt).
