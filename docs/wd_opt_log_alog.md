# Options dialog - Logging - Active Log View

- **Lines in Active Log View**\
The maximum number of log lines displayed in the Active Log View.\
When this number of lines is reached, older entries are removed to make room for new ones.\
In general we recommend the default value of 100.\
Higher values can impact performance, but may be helpful when troubleshooting.

- **Buffer Active Log View**\
When this option is enabled, Simple DNS Plus will continuously generate and buffer log data for the Active Log View.\
This way the latest log entries will always be immediate available when you open the Active Log View.\
This option can be very helpful for occasional troubleshooting, but generally it should be disabled to achieve the best performance.
